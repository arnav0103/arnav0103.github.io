  <h1>Harry Potter</h1>  
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d7/Harry_Potter_character_poster.jpg" alt="Try Again">
  <b><i><p>Harry James Potter (b. 31 July 1980) was an English half-blood wizard, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of James and Lily Potter, Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish Lord Voldemort, the most powerful and feared Dark Wizard in the world. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. In turn, this caused the Potter family to go into hiding.
<br>
    Voldemort made his first attempt to circumvent the prophecy when Harry was a year and three months old. During this attempt, he murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall. This downfall marked the end of the First Wizarding War, and to Harry henceforth being known as "The Boy Who Lived",as he was the only known survivor of the Killing Curse due to being magically protected by his mother's loving sacrifice. As per the terms of the prophecy, this attempt on his life also established him, not Neville, as Voldemort's nemisis.</p>

The only child and son of Tom and Merope Riddle, Riddle was raised in the Muggle-run Wool's Orphanage after his father abandoned his new family on the streets of London when the influence of her magic was lifted, and his mother died moments after giving birth to and naming him after his father and maternal grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt.</p>
